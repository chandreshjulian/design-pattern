# Design patterns

Design patterns are design level solutions for recurring problems that software engineers come across often. They are classified into three types, based on the kind of problem they solve:

- **Creational patterns**: These patterns are designed for class instantiation. They can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns. Some examples are singleton, factory, builder, prototype, etc.
- **Structural patterns**: These patterns are designed with regard to a classâ€™s structure and composition. The main goal of most of these patterns is to increase the functionality of the class (es) involved, without changing much of its composition. Some examples are adapter, bridge, composite, decorator, facade, etc.
- **Behavioral patterns**: These patterns are designed depending on how one class communicates with others. They involve the assignment of responsibilities and interactions between objects. Some examples are observer, strategy, command, iterator, template method, etc.

## Other notable patterns
- **Proxy Pattern**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control its access.
- **Memento Pattern**: Allows you to capture and restore an object's internal state without exposing its structure.
- **State Pattern**: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Flyweight Pattern**: Reduces memory usage by sharing common parts of objects across multiple instances.
- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**: Creates a chain of objects that can handle requests and passes the request along the chain until it's handled or reaches the end.
- **Interpreter Pattern**: Defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to interpret sentences in that language.
- **Mediator Pattern**: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling.
- **Visitor Pattern**: Lets you add further operations to objects without having to modify them.
- **Command Processor Pattern**: Keeps a history of commands, allowing for undo and redo functionality.
- **Null Object Pattern**: Provides an object as a surrogate for the lack of an object of a given type.
- **Dependency Injection Pattern**: Provides a way to create and manage dependencies between objects.
- **Service Locator Pattern**: Provides a centralized registry for retrieving services or components.
