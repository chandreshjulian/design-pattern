# Behavior Pattern

## Observer
The Observer pattern is implemented using the Observer interface as the base class for concrete observers (ConcreteObserverA and ConcreteObserverB). The Subject class serves as the subject being observed. Observers are added to the subject using addObserver, and they are notified of changes through the notify method.

The Observer pattern allows one-to-many relationships between objects. When the state of the subject changes, all its registered observers are notified and updated accordingly. This pattern is particularly useful for scenarios where multiple objects need to be informed of changes in another object's state.

## Strategy
The Strategy pattern is implemented using the PaymentStrategy interface as the base class for concrete strategies (CreditCardPayment and PayPalPayment). The ShoppingCart class serves as the context that uses different payment strategies based on the selected method during checkout.

The Strategy pattern allows you to encapsulate a family of interchangeable algorithms (strategies) and make them interchangeable within a context without changing the context's code. It's particularly useful when you have different ways of performing a certain operation and want to switch between them dynamically.

## Command
The Command pattern is implemented using the Command interface as the base class for concrete commands (TurnOnCommand and TurnOffCommand). The Light class is the receiver, and the RemoteControl class is the invoker that holds and executes the commands.

The Command pattern allows you to encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the requests. It also provides a way to decouple senders and receivers of commands, making it easier to extend the system with new commands without modifying existing code.

## Command Processor Pattern
The Command Processor Pattern (also known as the Command History Pattern) is implemented using the Command interface as the base class for concrete commands (LightOnCommand and LightOffCommand). The Light class serves as the receiver, and the CommandProcessor class acts as the invoker that holds a history of executed commands and supports undo functionality.

The Command Processor Pattern allows you to maintain a history of commands that have been executed and provides the ability to undo them. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to support undo and redo operations in your application.

## Iterator
The Iterator pattern is implemented using the Iterator interface as the base class for concrete iterators (ArrayIterator). The Aggregate interface is the base class for concrete aggregates (ArrayAggregate). The ArrayIterator iterates through an array of items, and the ArrayAggregate holds a collection of items.

The Iterator pattern provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It also decouples the client code from the collection structure, allowing for easy replacement of different types of iterators or aggregates.

## Template
The Template Method pattern is implemented using the AbstractClass as the base class with template methods (stepOne, stepTwo, stepThree). The ConcreteClass extends the abstract class and provides implementations for the template methods.

The Template Method pattern defines the structure of an algorithm in a base class but allows subclasses to provide specific implementations for certain steps of the algorithm. This allows you to define a common structure while allowing different variations of behavior in the subclasses.
